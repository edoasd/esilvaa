## About Me

I am a first year PhD student at École Normale Supérieure (Paris) under the direction of Anna Erschler.

I did my undergrad in Mathematical Engineering and a Master in Applied Mathematics in Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile). My Master thesis was under the direction of Michael Schraudner. Then I did a Master 2 at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord (Paris, France), and my Master memoire was under the direction of Romain Tessera.

## Research Interests

My main interests are symbolic dynamics on groups, and Geometric Group Theory. My preferred topics are studying the growth of groups and geometrical properties of Cayley graphs.
